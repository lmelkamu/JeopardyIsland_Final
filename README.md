# JeopardyIsland_Final
Welcome to Jeopardy Island! 
This two-player game takes players on a trip through various islands where they must compete to correctly answer a trivia question in order to move forward. 

# Setting up
To begin, input into the terminal your preferred difficulty and each players' name. The difficulty input corresponds to how many islands are generated on the map. Once the map is generated players are allowed to choose their avatar color by pressing the 'a' or 'l' key. When players are satisfied, press the spacebar to start the game. 

# How to answer
A question will be presented and players must compete to buzz in first in order to answer, similarly to Jeopardy. Player one's buzzer is the 'q' key while player two's is the 'p' key. The fastest contestant will then answer the multiple choice question presented to them by pressing the 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd' key.

Depending on if the player answers correctly they will either gain or lose points corresponding to the difficulty of the question. Easy questions are scored a 1 point, medium at 3 points, and hard at 5 points. Additionally, if the player answers correctly they are able to choose their next island, otherwise the opposing player will.

# Choosing next island
When choosing the next island players are able to toggle through all the neighboring islands to their current island by pressing the 't' key. The question category and difficulty will be displayed when toggling. Players can then lock in their island by pressing the 'y' key and the next question will display. 

Players can continue traversing through their neighboring islands and collecting points, until they run into an island with no neighboring nodes at which point the game will end and the player with more points will win.
